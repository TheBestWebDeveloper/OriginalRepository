<h1> About </h1> 
<p> My name is Brendan. I'm currently enrolled at Issaquah High School, but I'm doing a program called Running Start, where I take classes
at Bellevue College instead of my normal High School classes. </p>
<p> After each day of school, I typically return to my home, and work on homework. I then usually do some 3d modeling and 3d printing as well.
I'm also a gamer. I play games such as War Thunder, Minecraft, and Kerbal Space Program. </p>
<p> My academic goals include going to Arizona State University after I graduate High School. I plan on majoring in Mechanical Engineering, and to become a Mechanical
  Engineer afterwards. </p>
