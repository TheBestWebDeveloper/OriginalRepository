<p> This my paragraph about what I enjoy doing in my free time. I enjoy 3d printing, 3d modeling, and playing videogames. 
I have made several projects with 3d printing and 3d modeling, such a making a lock, a tiger tank, and other objects. 
Some games I enjoy playing are Minecraft, War Thunder, and Kerbal Space Program. 
I enjoy these games because they have a lot of action in them, and are always fun to play. 
I usually play these with friends, as then they are more fun for me to play. </p>
