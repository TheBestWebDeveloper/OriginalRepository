<p> What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript? 
  My previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript was not that great. I knew how to create tables, headings, paragraphs, and how to format a new HTML document. 
  For CSS, I only knew how to set the background color, change a text color, and how to use classes. 
  For Javascript, I knew almost nothing about it except a general idea on how to use functions and if statements. </p>
<p> Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch? 
  I built my portfolio from scratch. I did not use any sort of template. </p>
<p> What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.) 
  The most challenging part of my portfolio was figuring out how to put my links at the top of each page, because I had to put it on every page which took
  a lot of work. It was also challenging because I had to make sure the links actually worked, and it took the longest time of all the parts on the portfolio. </p>
<p> How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
  This class has changed my view on web development by showing me all these new ways I can use to customize my websites. 
  I plan on using what I learned in this class in future websites I create. I may even pursue a career in web development. </p>
<p> What would you recommend to future students taking this class? 
  I would definitely recommend that future students should take this class. This class is very good at engaging us with our peers.
  In this class, you learn many new skills needed to create cool websites too. </p>
